# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project**: Add the two remaining analytics-layer deliverables to sentiment-opencode. The app already has /v2/analytics/summary and /v2/analytics/terms working with 192 tests at 97.06% coverage; this is new work on top, not a rebuild. 1. The analytics view. The page has a nav and a summary region already. Add the terms section and the date-range control, so the two existing /v2 endpoints are fully usable from the page. This must close the two NFR targets still marked Unverified in the prior intent's record: NFR4.6 (per-section graceful degradation — a partial-failure marker when one section succeeds and another fails) and NFR4.7 (no silent retry, and a superseded out-of-order response is discarded). Both were blocked on this markup. The contract is pinned: shares are 4dp half-up fractions with null on a zero denominator; an empty range returns an empty series, not zeros; zero-fill applies only to internal gaps of a matched range. 2. The platform packaging. The verification script (install -> lint -> pytest with the 80% coverage floor and ruff), a secret scanner, and a dependency-audit check. FR7.3 covers the scanner. These are the two instruments named as absent in the prior intent's artifacts (G9/G10 in its CI config). Constraints that still bind: /v1 must not change; runtime dependencies stay at exactly two (fastapi, uvicorn); no pydantic in app/; no new external service; all tests offline with the session guard armed. The prior intent at aidlc/spaces/default/intents/261001-analytics-layer/ has 232 artifacts describing the requirements, contracts and known gaps — read it rather than re-deriving, and read ENGINE-DEFECT-REPORT.md for why this is a fresh intent.
